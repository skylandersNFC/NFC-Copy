00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,508
This is a video how to write Skylanders on a

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:04,760
NS106 Reader/Writer.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,145
We start from the skylandersnfc.github.io, go to

4
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:14,546
the Skylanders Buying List, then NFC devices and here you

5
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:15,760
can see NS106.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,014
You can get it from AliExpress and here is a

7
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:21,039
software for it.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,103
I only recommend the first one, the NFC Copy and

9
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:26,719
go to this GitHub page for it.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,073
Then we go releases, and from releases we download this

11
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:36,799
zip archive.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,721
So having this zip, I'm going to extract it here

13
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,839
and I'll just run it.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,080
You don't meddle with any of the options here.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,320
You just need to insert an empty tag.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,960
Previously the reader was flashing red.

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,725
Now I've put a tag on it and it's flashing

18
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:55,120
green.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,080
I will just click "Start decode".

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,000
Now the cart is decoded.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,462
I use "Import dump" and select one of my dumps

22
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:06,519
which are from the Ultimate NFC Pack.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,030
If you don't have them, you go back to this

24
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:11,280
resource called The Crypt.

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,366
You go Ultimate NFC Pack and you download them from

26
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,720
either Mega or Google Drive or whatever.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,210
Assuming you already have those dumps, you select for example "Bash"

28
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:24,879
It says the data will be abnormal.

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,240
That's perfectly OK.

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,440
You click "Write card" and that's it.

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,680
That's the whole process.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,920
If you have UID Re-Writable cards, that's it.

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,977
Now if I click "Card number", I will see the

34
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:42,000
new UID of the card I've created.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,080
Now this is very good indication.

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,341
Remember this 90 37 7C 9F 

37
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:52,119
I'll go to my dump files.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,006
For example, I'll go to my "Bash" dump and I'll

39
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,879
open it with a program that is called HxD.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,513
I'll see the UID of this dump is basically the

41
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:02,799
same.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,007
It's 90 37 7C 9F and this is an indication that

43
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,105
I was actually using UID Re-Writable card

44
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,200
and my card was able to change it's UID.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,040
However, now I will remove this card and I'll put

46
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:19,760
another card.

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,160
Now the second card is UID LOCKED.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,622
It means it won't change it's UID no matter what

49
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:26,920
I do.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,323
The process for UID locked cards is a bit

51
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:30,879
different.

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,440
I click start decode.

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,280
Now the card is decoded.

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,801
However, I cannot import dumps directly as before because they

55
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:42,840
won't match the locked UID of the card.

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,960
For example, let's say I want to get this Boomer.

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,040
I will just open Boomer with the HxD software.

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
It has "D5 A9 CB 0D" UID.

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,814
If I click on card number I see my card

60
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:08,320
UID is 12345678.

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,440
This UID will never change.

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,707
I cannot get Boomer directly on this card because the

63
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:20,398
card needs to be written with a dump that is

64
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,679
with UID 12345678 and NOT "D5A9CB0D".

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,666
In this case, when you have a UID locked card,

66
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:37,309
you go back to The Crypt page and you look

67
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,600
for SkyUID Generator.

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
You open this software.

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,949
There is a tutorial here, you can read it, but

70
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:47,431
pretty much now I'm just going to show you how

71
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:47,959
it works.

72
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,500
I'm going to download the zip file from the releases

73
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,040
and I'm going to extract it and run it.

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,680
Now it asks for my UID.

75
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
How do I get the UID?

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,560
I click card number.

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,233
My UID is 12345678 so I put this 12345678

78
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,959
and make sure it's correct.

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,480
So here I have to select the dump I want.

80
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,389
All the dumps are included right there inside this dumps

81
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:19,799
folder.

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,686
They are from the Ultimate NFC Pack so you don't

83
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,240
have to worry about the dumps.

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,103
From here I'll select for example Boomer and now the

85
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,357
dump I'm going to generate for Boomer, it will be

86
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,080
adjusted for this UID 12345378.

87
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,650
I click generate and now I have a new dump

88
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:41,960
here.

89
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,281
And now if I open this dump with HxD, take

90
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,736
a look at the UID, it's actually adjusted for my

91
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:50,159
card.

92
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,398
Let me again show you this on the original Boomer

93
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,879
and now check the new adjusted Boomer.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,642
The new Boomer is actually ready for my UID locked

95
00:04:58,695 --> 00:04:58,959
card.

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,886
I click import dump but this time I go where the

97
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:03,720
new generated

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,040
dump is here.

99
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,000
I get the new dump.

100
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,800
It again says abnormal data.

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,360
Whatever, I don't care.

102
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,427
Click right card and 63 blocks were written because the

103
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,520
UID will never change from this card.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,380
Now if I click card number, the UID is the

105
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:20,720
same.

106
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,670
But that's OK because I've adjusted my dump for this

107
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:24,920
UID.

108
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
Now I have two working tags.

109
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,573
I have UID Re-Writable one with the changed UID

110
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,026
from the original dump, and I have a UID locked

111
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:36,479
one with the generated dump for the locked UID.

112
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,120
That's it.

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,360
That's the whole process.
